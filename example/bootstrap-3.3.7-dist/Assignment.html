            <p class="text">In the UK and Ireland adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, 
                whereas in America, Australia and Canada they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than 
                a year old are cockerels.[8] Castrated roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration
                are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens and younger 
                females as pullets[9] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins 
                to lay eggs at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), 
                here is a generic term chook /ˈtʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[10] The young are called 
                chicks and the meat is called chicken.
                "Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.[11] The species as a whole was then called 
                domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", 
                sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and 
                many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The word 
                "chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term 
                "hen" for females being in wide circulation.
                In the Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.[12]  
                General biology and habitat

                In some breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb
                Chickens are omnivores.[13] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects
                and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes or young mice.[14]

                Chickens may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[15] The world's oldest chicken, a 
                hen, died of heart failure at the age of 16 according to Guinness World Records.[16]
